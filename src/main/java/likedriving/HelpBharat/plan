Create a help about -

1. Bharart's current geography and
2. history of her geography


Elaborating on point 1 -

Bharat a political entity today consists of
1. 29 states and 9 UTs.
2. 738 districts
3. Each district is divided into tahsils and
4. Each tahsil has various villages
5. One major city might consist of multiple districts as well

The idea is to create a database of these geographical entities and store information about them like -
1. Prominnent people like historical giants who have been from that place
2. Prominent places like natural or man made - river, temple, mountain etc (historical and geopgraphical places)

Functionality -
There would be some way to update info about a place and read info about a geographical entity
