A small app which used redis.
Figures out redis string serialization.
Uses object mapper for serialization and deserialization.

Drawback -
Uses redis string value to store destination store list which makes it difficult
to search on name, and address.

Next APP -
Shall create a similar app which uses redis hashes to store destination list.
